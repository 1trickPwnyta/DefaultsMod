Tired of having to go through the same ritual every time you start a new colony of configuring your colonists' schedules, setting your quest reward preferences, turning down the medicine setting so you don't waste your good medicine on bruises, and more? This mod allows you to customize various default settings to use during gameplay, such as the default schedules your colonists will assume. See below for a full list of settings.
